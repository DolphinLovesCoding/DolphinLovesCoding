- 👋 Hi, I’m @DolphinLovesCoding
- 👀 I’m interested in Scratch, and I also work on Atom, the HTML programming software, and last, I work on GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a chatting app, and if you know how to make it, you can teach me!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of my projects.
- 📫 Well, just collaborate to me on those GitHub projects.
